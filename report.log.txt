Existing .quant files will be used
Thread number set to 17
Min fragment m/z set to 200
Max fragment m/z set to 1800
In silico digest will involve cuts at K*,R*
Maximum number of missed cleavages set to 2
Min peptide length set to 7
Max peptide length set to 30
Min precursor m/z set to 300
Max precursor m/z set to 1800
Min precursor charge set to 1
Max precursor charge set to 4
Cysteine carbamidomethylation enabled as a fixed modification
Maximum number of variable modifications set to 1
Modification UniMod:35 with mass delta 15.9949 at M will be considered as variable
Mass accuracy will be determined separately for different runs
Scan windows will be inferred separately for different runs
A spectral library will be created from the DIA runs and used to reanalyse them; .quant files will only be saved to disk during the first step
When generating a spectral library, in silico predicted spectra will be retained if deemed more reliable than experimental ones
Fixed-width center of each elution peak will be used for quantification
Interference removal from fragment elution curves disabled
Mass accuracy will be fixed to 2e-05 (MS2) and 2e-05 (MS1)
